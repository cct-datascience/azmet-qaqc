# azmet-qaqc

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of azmet-qaqc is to create scripts to run QA/QC on AZMet data.

## Reproducibility

This project uses
[`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for package
management. When opening this repo as an RStudio Project for the first
time, `renv` should automatically install itself and prompt you to run
`renv::restore()` to install all package dependencies.

This project uses the [`targets`
package](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) for workflow management.
Run `targets::tar_make()` from the console to run the workflow and
reproduce all results.

## Repo Structure

- `wrangling/` contains a script for scraping weather data from 2003
  onward that isnâ€™t available through the API / the `azmetr` package.
  This should only need to be run once ever.
- `data/` contains the .csv file of the historic data (since 2003)
- `notes/` contains quarto documents of notes / analysis.
  `sliding-windows.qmd` is an exploration of a sliding-window quantile
  approach that is probably not going to work for us. `azmet-qaqc.qmd`
  is an exploration of QA by forecasting.
- `docs/` contains quarto documents that get rendered by the targets
  pipeline.
- `renv/` is necessary for the `renv` package to work (see below)
- `_quarto.yml` contains project-level quarto render configs
- `_targets.R` defines a `targets` workflow
- `_targets` is generated by `targets::tar_make()` and only the metadata
  of the targets pipeline is on github.

## Collaboration guidelines

To contribute to this project, please create a new branch for your
changes and make a pull request. One easy way to do this from within R
is with the `usethis` package and the `pr_*` functions.
`pr_init("branch-name")` begins a new branch locally, `pr_push()` helps
you create a new pull request, and after it is merged you can use
`pr_finish()` to clean things up. More about this workflow
[here](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/pr-functions.html).
